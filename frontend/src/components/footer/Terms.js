            By creating a Matcha account, whether through a mobile device, or
            computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i)
            these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy,
            Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), Safety Tips, and
            Community Guidelines, each of which is incorporated by reference
            into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by
            you if you purchase additional features, products or services we
            offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not
            accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement,
            please do not use the Service. <br /> <br />
            We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time
            to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to
            reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or
            changes in business practices. The most recent version of this
            Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on
            gotinder.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent
            version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the
            changes include material changes to your rights or obligations, we
            will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless
            we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means,
            which could include notification through the Service or via email.
            If you continue to use the Service after the changes become
            effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
