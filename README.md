Matcha/Hive Helsinki -> **ON-GOING-PROJECT**

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Project's goal:**
Matcha is a Hive's School project. The idea here is to build a dating app. <br />
Starting from the frontend to the backend and handling all Geolocation matters as well.
<br />
The project goal is to learn the use of micro-framework and the ability to build <br /> 
a big web application that can be available for manyusers simultaneously.
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the web app should be working in real time. Meaning that any updates <br /> 
happens to any user, should render in the app right away like in the real world applications.
<br />
